The Project concept was taken from an idea I had to provide coping  skills during stressfull times. My friends and I recently lost a lot of money in the crypto drop and the best way to let loose is with a good Kentucky Beer! 

PLEASE RUN PROJECT LOCALLY 

Features list: 

1. Fetch() Both the Brewery List and the Crypto Prices are pulled from Public Open API's. 

2. Save Data to a file on click of Submit. As demonstrated by TreeHouse. The Rest API is JSONplaceHolder.typicode.com which is a free fake rest API. This API sends the data back to the user and displays it in the console to show that it "saved" or "persisted". I have also pulled this data from the API and displayed in the HTML for convience. 

3. regex. There are two regex's in the code both for the form. the first regex is looking for lowercase day and number in this format "day 1" and the second is looking for one lowercase word such as "braxtonlabs". Simply input a stock price day and a brewery and you will see your data adjacent to the form! If the correct input is entered the Pink information banners will dissapear.
